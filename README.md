This repository contains the data and code to reproduce the analyses and plot the figures presented in 'Denning phenology mediates sea-ice loss impacts on early reproductive success in polar bears'.

- PA_CR_phenology.Rmd is used to build and run the Bayesian path-analysis capture-recapture model presented in the main text.

- PA_girth.R is used to run the Bayesian path model for late-summer girth.

- plot_main_figures.R is used to plot the main figures, suign the outputs from the models.

- The folder 01_inputs/ contains the datasets required to run the analyses

- The folder 02_outputs/ contains the output of the Bayesian path-analysis capture-recapture model. Note that the model output generated by the code contains the posterior samples of all denning dates whereas the model ouput included here does (otherwise the files are too large).
